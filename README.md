# Computational Gene Expression Analysis
I used R on RNA sequencing data obtained from fusion inhibited C2C12 muscle cells to conduct statistical analysis and create data visualizations (volcano plot, Principent Component Analysis (PCA) plot, heatmap) to cluster key genes by characteristics and pinpoint the dysregulated expression of key genes significantly involved in muscular diseases.
